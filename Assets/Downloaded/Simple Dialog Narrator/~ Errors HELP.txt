IF YOU ENCOUNTER ERRORS
========================

Help help !! Simple Dialog Narrator is NOT working / showing !!!
calm down...

try the following first :-

------------------

1) Is your camera set to "Orthographic" mode? SDN only works in "Orthographic".
Perspective view is not supported.

------------------

2) Perhaps your camera scale is too small. The default font size may be too big.

Go to the font size property "SimpleDialogCall.cs inspector property -> a dialog ->
                              Optional Properties -> Header font size & Text Font size"

set the font size to about 1~5 and then work your way up. If your font is blurry, suggest editing
the dialog prefab's font gameObject's localScale to about x = y = z = 0.02f... then increase the font size as necessary.



------------------
still cannot?
