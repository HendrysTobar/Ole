You can view the Demo scene;
but you will notice how simple the dialog narrator is :)

---------------------------------

HOW TO USE "Simple Dialog Narrator"

step 1:  add "SimpleDialogCall.cs" script located in the main folder to ANY gameObject.

step 2: customise your dialog as you see fit :)

step 3: play the scene... simple!

----------------

P.S.> all values in the "Optional Properties" tab will use the prefab's default unless change is specified.
e.g. 
      Font size 0 -> uses prefab's font size
      Font blank -> uses prefab's assigned font
      Font color all value 0 -> uses prefab's font color
         IMPORTANT -> when changing font color, Don't forget to adjust the 'ALPHA' value as well!




Further Customisation
==========================

1) You can change the way the dialog looks like by changing the default prefab located in "Simple Dialog Narrator/Resources/DialogPrefab"

P.S.> please change the GUIs. Add more stuff to the prefab as you wish BUT DO NOT alter the name of the provided gameObjects.
the script relies on the 'exact' name of the gameObjects defined to work correctly.

----------------


2) You can opt to provide a dialog prefab in the inspector properties of SimpleDialogCall.cs. Under the "Optional properties -> Dialog properties -> prefab"

This will allow you to define more than one dialog GUI style as appose to using the default all the time.
P.S.> as per above, please leave the names of the gameObjects intact within a dialog prefab.

----------------

3) Feel free to add / modify the available script to meet your custom needs.
However, please keep track of the changes made to make it easier for your to merge with future updates. TQ
